# 👋 Hi there, I'm Hamza Ben Allal!

I'm a Computer Science Engineer from Badalona, Barcelona, Spain. I have a diverse background in IT ranging from technical support to full-stack development and research. 

I love to solve complex problems using technology and am always eager to learn and adapt to new tech trends. Currently, I'm focusing on cloud computing and other upcoming technologies.

🔭 My current project in private is **AlgerNoun**, a low-cost SaaS solution for language learning. We're still in the beta phase, but I'm excited about creating a user-friendly learning environment with this project.

💼 Currently, I'm working as a Specialist Research Support Technician at TALN where I'm focusing on natural language processing, data analysis, and cloud computing.

👨‍💻 Some of the technologies I enjoy working with include Java, Python, NodeJS, PHP, Typescript, Angular, React, MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB and more.

🌍 I'm fluent in English, Spanish, Catalan, and Arabic.
